# cacophony

What do you watch when you browse through YouTube? What are you exposed to in doing so? Personalized content? Relateable advertising? Trash?
What remains of the sounds once you've finished watching or have clicked away? What of the memories?

This project attempts to address some these issues and create an informational and artistic experience that results from often passive media consumption that occurs (and is encouraged) on a site like YouTube.

To run, install the requirements within a venv:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `browser.py` to open a browser (Firefox or Chrome) and spend some time watching YouTube (or use it whenever you want to watch)
3. Run `play.py` to begin audio playback
