# cacophony is an experiment in representing media

What do you watch when you browse through YouTube? What are you exposed to as you do?
What remains of the sounds once you've finished watching or have clicked away? What about the memories?

This project attempts to address these issues and create an informational and artistic experience that results from often passive media consumption that occurs (and is encouraged) on a site like YouTube.

To run, install the requirements
1. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run browser.py to open a browser and spend some time watching YouTube (or use it whenever you want to watch)
3. Run play.py to begin audio playback
